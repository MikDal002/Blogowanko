This month I was able to purchase the domain programitonce.com, and enable the comment system - a big step that allows me to share the blog bluntly with others. 
Now it's slowly time to improve the style of the site, where it fails. 

The articles produced this month are:

.An article about the ills of asynchronous programming and the critical section in .Net
* link:{{% ref "/programowanie/dotnet/bolączki-i-problemy/async-locki/index.adoc" %}}[Async, locks and monitors – where is the problem?],


.completed tab on the left menu
* link:{{% ref "/page/about" %}}[About]

Yes, I know I've written terribly little this month. 
This is due to my vacation and other extremely important events that have taken over my life this month - positively, of course!

Is there anything you'd like to see changed on the blog? Maybe you have a topic you'd like to learn more about? Go ahead, write in comments!

Yes, as I write these words, the comment system finally works!
