= When you want to nicely show that a value is NULL

[.lead]
XAML has tremendous capabilities and I guess most of them are still unknown to me, and the few that I do learn often fly out of my mind due to unit usage. 
In this note, I would like to keep my knowledge of `{((Binding TargetNullValue="..."))}` for longer because I find it useful and definitely speed up application development. 

== `((TargetNullValue))`

By default, in most examples I have seen `TargetNullValue` being used like this:

[source,xml]
.Example of using `((TargetNullValue))`.
----
<Label Content="{Binding MyText TargetNullValue=You did not specify a value}" />
----

Nowhere so far have I encountered the use of another control in place of `TargetNullValue`, but it is possible!
There are a few pitfalls when doing this, but everything is explained in the example below:

.Example of using `((TargetNullValue))`, where the value is another XAML control

<ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Properties}">
    <ListView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <Label>
                <Label.Resources>
                    <ResourceDictionary>
                        <Syncfusion:SfBusyIndicator x:Key="Busy" x:Shared="False" IsBusy="True" AnimationType="Message" /> <1>
                    </ResourceDictionary>
                </Label.Resources>
                <Label.Content>
                    <Binding Path="Value" TargetNullValue="{StaticResource Busy}" /> <2>
                </Label.Content>
            </Label>
        </DataTemplate>
    </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>

<1> The element we want to display when our value is `null`. 
Note that it is inside the `((ResourceDictionary))` dictionary, and most importantly it is marked `((x:Shared))="False"` - this is essential. 
Without this, using a given element repeatedly will result in errors such as, that our `((SfBusyIndicator))` will only display in one place. 
<2> Proper binding definition - note that the value is set by standard, and `TargetNullValue` refers directly to our dictionary using the `((StaticResource))` construct. 

With this solution, we get an independent loading indicator anywhere the value is `null`!
Note also that using this technique, I was forced to make a custom column template for `((GridView))` - in the course of my efforts, I was unable to get this working in a simpler way.

.An example of how the code works, where the control is the value for `((TargetNullValue))`. This is a gif, so it should move.
